# `signal.dc-offset@1`

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED audio-qc-docs:definition (scripts/audio_qc_docs.py regen; edit its sources, not this block) -->
Registry entry `signal.dc-offset@1` in [config/audio-qc-detectors.json](../../../../config/audio-qc-detectors.json); definition digest `6650589ce438b1f7` (a plan binds it, so any change is a new version, A7).

**Measures.** The magnitude of the DC offset (the absolute value of Fast QC v8 dcOffset).

| Class | Stage | Direction | Combination | Unit | Thresholds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (signal) | 0 | above | single | full-scale | per language |

**Strata.** FLEURS records each locale separately, under its own conditions, so each language is its own clean distribution (clean N2 aligner tail gap, 95th percentile: 2.0 s in ru to 4.3 s in zh).

**Score components.**

| Languages | Components | Requires complete |
|---|---|---|
| chinese, english, french, german, italian, japanese, korean, portuguese, russian, spanish | [`fastqc@8`](../judges/fastqc-v8.md) absolute fastqc `dcOffset` | - |

**Scope.** chinese, english, french, german, italian, japanese, korean, portuguese, russian, spanish.

**Positives and shams.**

| Injector | Severities | Mechanism | Matched sham |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SIG-DC` | severe | T1-pcm-construction | yes |

**Populations** (role set `fleurs-n2`): fit N2 (calibration, fleurs-dev); confirmNegatives N2 (confirmation, fleurs-test); positives P1 (confirmation); shams S (confirmation); informational N3, N1.

**Limitations.**

- `fleurs-no-speaker-ids`: FLEURS publishes no speaker ids; its TSVs give only a gender per recording. Speaker disjointness between the dev (calibration) and test (confirmation) splits cannot be verified, and neither can a speaker count: family and script disjointness hold, speaker disjointness is assumed, not shown.
- `fleurs-speaker-lower-bound`: Units carry the speaker '<language>:fleurs-unidentified', a lower bound on the speaker count: FLEURS collects each locale separately, so recordings of different languages cannot share a speaker. The policy minimum of 3 speakers is therefore met only by covering at least 3 languages.
- `n2-one-codec`: N2 is one production codec round trip (the pro_clone speed variant at full codebooks) of FLEURS read speech; FAR on it is in the codec's domain, not on natural Vocello takes (N3, informational at warn).

**Lanes it gates** ([config/audio-qc-lane-gates.json](../../../../config/audio-qc-lane-gates.json)): none.

## Qualification

**Status.** Not qualified; planned, not confirmed.

**Plan.** [config/audio-qc-preregistrations/signal.dc-offset@1.json](../../../../config/audio-qc-preregistrations/signal.dc-offset@1.json): digest `e425f9988ffe5795`, rule split-conformal, alpha 0.05, confidence 0.95, operating point warn, population N2; injector catalog 2, classes A,B,C,D,F, 150 per cell.
Calibration cohort audio-qc-n2-cohort (fleurs-dev, manifest `59221512a00b2b4a`); confirmation cohort audio-qc-n2-cohort (fleurs-test, manifest `ae62a87f35ed9b7c`).

**Confirmation.** Not run: no ledger entry.

**Not qualified.** No committed calibration record qualifies it: its measurements compose as `uncalibrated` and it gates no lane.
